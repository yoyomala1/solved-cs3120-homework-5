1.Read through Slide11 and 12, watch video lectures of neural networks.

2.Run the code “8_NN_2layer.py” (blackboard)

3. Trains the NN more than 1,000 times and observe the change of the loss value.

<ol start="4">

 <li>Implement a <strong>“3-6-2” network</strong> (using code 8_NN_2layer.py) to fit the following data:</li>

</ol>

X=np.array(([0,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]), dtype=float)

y=np.array(([0,1],[1,0],[1,0],[0,1]), dtype=float)




<ol start="5">

 <li>What are the dimension of weight matrix 1 and weight matrix 2? (5pts)</li>

 <li>Test the two following samples and write down the predicted y values for them. (5 pts)</li>

</ol>

Testing sample one: X1 = [0, 0, 0]    y1=[? ?]

Testing sample two: X2 = [1,1,1]      y2=[? ?]
